	   <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Differences Between Spas
Confusion often comes because the distinctions that the spa industry used to convey what kind of experience the guest could expect have become blurred.<br><br>

Traditional destination spas offering an immersive wellness experience now call themselves spa resorts. On the other hand, traditional resort spas have added more wellness options like exercise classes, personal trainers, even consultations with integrative medical professionals.<br><br>

But if you like to go to spas or are just thinking about going for the first time, it's worth getting a handle on the different types of spas and how the labels are being played with so that you have the kind of experience you're expecting.<br><br>

Spa Definition<br><br>
The International Spa Association defines spas as "places devoted to enhancing overall well-being through a variety of professional services that encourage the renewal of mind, body, and spirit.” <br><br>

This is an extremely broad definition that is meant to include all the various types of spas in operation—approximately 20,000 in the United States.<br><br>

Here are the different types of spas and what you need to know about them to be a savvy spa consumer.<br><br>

Day Spas<br><br>
This is a place where you can get usually get, at a minimum, massage, and facials, on a day-visit basis. About 80% of spas are day spas, but they aren't all the same. Day spas include places like low-cost chains with no locker rooms or robes because you undress in the room. Sometimes small local spas with a few rooms have this same model.<br><br>

Traditional day spas offer more services, including body treatments and nails. They have amenities like changing rooms, robes and slippers, steam room, sauna, and a "tranquility room" with treats like tea, lemon water, and dried fruit and nuts. Day spas are often associated with a hair salon but should be in a separate wing or on a different floor to keep a calm spa atmosphere.<br><br>

Many resort spas are open to locals on a day-use basis, but are more expensive and have more lavish facilities.<br><br>

Destination Spas <br><br>
This small but select and highly influential group of spas (less than 100 in the U.S.) devoted to providing an immersive wellness experience.<br><br>

The whole environment is geared towards promoting a healthy lifestyle, with lots of exercise classes, lectures aimed at physical and mental wellness, and special interest programs, such as hiking. Destination spas usually require a minimum stay of two to three nights and encourage longer stays. The destinations are often age-restricted; usually, teens 16 and over are allowed.<br><br>

The most famous (and expensive) examples of the traditional destination spa include Canyon Ranch and Golden Door. There are more budget-friendly options that provide a health-oriented experience without the luxury factor.<br><br>

The tricky thing about destinations spas is that even though everyone in the industry knows what the term means, most consumers don't. Since consumer-directed internet searches are so important, most destination spas have changed their names to "Spa Resort" or "Resort and Spa" to reflect how they are being searched on the internet.<br><br>

Prices are usually all-inclusive of accommodations, meals, classes, and lectures. Often the locations include a spa credit that you can use toward services.
